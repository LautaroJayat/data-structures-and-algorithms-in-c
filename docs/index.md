When starting out in programming, it is common to perceive certain aspects or behaviors as 'magical'.

For example, if the first language you have learned was JavaScript or Python, dynamic arrays and dictionaries/objects are often taken for granted. They work as intended, requiring only the reading of the API documentation to utilize them. There are no memory allocations, resizing, hashing functions, or other low-level implementation details to worry about.

Exploring the reasoning behind various data structures and how one can use them to implement algorithms may reduce the amount of magic involved in programming. It empowers newcomers in the field by building critical thinking skills and allowing them to make informed decisions.

I hope these examples end up being useful to someone
